# Modifications Based on clib2 (BSD-3-Clause)

AmyCLib is an AmigaOS-oriented C runtime support library, selectively based on **clib2**  
(originally written by Olaf Barthel and licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license).

This version has been heavily refactored by Rene W. Olsen to suit my AmigaOS development needs.  
Only the necessary parts of clib2 were cherry-picked and adapted.
